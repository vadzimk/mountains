## Overview
This is my solution to a skill test of landing page development from a marketing agency.

Implemented using TailwindCSS, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, deployed to OCI infrastructure.  
All elements are responsive including the carousel and tabs/accordion.
Navbar mobile implementation was not required.

### Requirements Specification:

> “Convert the PSD to HTML that is provided below.  
Goal is to convert this into a single page response site. The carousel should be responsive. On mobile, the tabs should be converted to an accordion. History, team - these are internal links in the page to their respective sections.”
